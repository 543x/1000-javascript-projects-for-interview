Creating a list of 1000 JavaScript project widgets is a pretty big task, as it would need to cover a wide range of projects from simple utilities to complex applications. However, I can give you a rough outline and some ideas that you can use to conceive and expand your list.

### 1. Practical widgets

1. **Web timer**: A simple countdown or timer for cooking, exercising, or any other scenario that requires timing.

### Extension Ideas

To complete the list of 1,000 JavaScript project gadgets, you can further refine each project from the above categories, or add new categories and projects. For example, you can consider adding projects related to game development, Internet of Things (IoT), Virtual Reality (VR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), etc.

In addition, you can combine and expand existing projects to create more unique gadgets. For example, you can combine the weather query and chart generator to create a chart application that can display the changes in weather data in real time.

Remember that this is just a starting point, and the real key lies in your creativity and imagination. I hope these ideas can inspire you and help you come up with more interesting and useful JavaScript project gadgets!

## Learn and practice

Each project is designed to help you master the core concepts of JavaScript, such as DOM manipulation, event handling, asynchronous programming (such as using the Fetch API to call external data), and CSS style and layout techniques. By implementing these projects, you will be able to more confidently face technical challenges in interviews and demonstrate your practical ability.

## How to get started

1. **Browse the project list**: First, browse the list of all projects and choose the project that you are interested in or find challenging to start.
2. **Download the code**: Download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files of each project from the links provided.
